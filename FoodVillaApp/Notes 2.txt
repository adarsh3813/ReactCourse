1.  Input in react does not work by default- this is 
    due to one-way data binding.
    One way binding- helps to control when/where change happens in our local variable,
    better optimization 

    When we type in the text box react re-renders it 

    If we need to need to maintain a variable that changes with text input data, then 
    never use local variable (like const searchData)
    We need a react kind of variable that maintains state??

    Every component in react maintains a state 

2.  What is hooks?

    Hooks are just js functions, which have a specific functions (like useState() hook- create state variables).
    It comes from react, using named import.

    useState()-  returns an array, the element of the array is the var name

3.  Synthetic events
