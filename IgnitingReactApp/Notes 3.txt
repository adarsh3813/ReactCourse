Notes 3:

1.  What is key in react, why used?

    special attribute that needs to be included when rendering arrays of elements, helps React identify which items have changed,
    added or removed, important for Efficient Reconciliation, Without keys, React may have to re-render the entire list whenever there's a change

6.  Why we use JSX?

    has a more readable syntax, makes Component Composition easy,

7.  How is babel included? how many package.json are in our project? Why?

    Babel comes with parcel, can be installed separately, supports plug-ins to extend functionality

    2 package.json, in node_modules, for storing data about verions of transitive dependencies
